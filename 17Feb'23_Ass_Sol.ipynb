    "'''MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database that stores data in a document-oriented format using JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. \n",
    "MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally and handle large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data, making it a popular choice for modern web and mobile applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional relational data model based on tables and schema. \n",
    "Instead, they use flexible data models that can handle unstructured, semi-structured, and polymorphic data types. \n",
    "NoSQL databases are highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data and are often used in scenarios where data is rapidly changing or requires flexible and fast queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where there is a need for high scalability, performance, and flexibility. \n",
    "For instance, MongoDB is often used in applications that require real-time analytics, real-time data processing, and high-speed data ingestion. \n",
    "Also, it is commonly used in modern web and mobile applications that require flexible data models and schemaless databases. \n",
    "SQL databases, on the other hand, are preferred in scenarios where data is highly structured and the relationships between data are well-defined, such as in financial systems or enterprise resource planning systems.'''"

    "#Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",

    "\n",
    "'''Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, which means it can handle data with varying fields and structures. \n",
    "This makes it ideal for handling unstructured and semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. High Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers and clusters, which allows it to handle large volumes of data and traffic. \n",
    "This also means that it can handle increasing workload without compromising on performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Flexible Data Model: MongoDB's flexible data model allows for easy modification and updating of data, as well as support for nested and hierarchical data structures. \n",
    "This means that developers can easily modify their data models as their application evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Indexing and Querying: MongoDB has powerful indexing and querying capabilities, including support for text search, geospatial queries, and aggregation queries. \n",
    "This makes it easy to find and analyze data quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Automatic Sharding: MongoDB's automatic sharding feature distributes data across multiple servers, which allows for better load balancing and improved performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Easy Integration: MongoDB integrates easily with popular programming languages, such as Python, Java, and Node.js, and with popular tools and frameworks, such as Hadoop and Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. High Availability: MongoDB offers automatic failover and replication features, which ensure that data is always available, even in the event of hardware failure or network issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB's features make it a powerful and flexible database solution for modern applications that require scalability, performance, and flexibility.'''"
